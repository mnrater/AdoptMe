# AdoptMe

*CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS* <br>
*AS AT 21.10.2021*

AdoptMe is a pet adoption site made in Java, Spring and React.
It is a product being created out of love to pets and dedicated to the problem of animal homelessness. In 2019, there were as many as 105,188 dogs and 31,116 cats in shelters in Poland. In the same year, 66,030 dogs were adopted from animal shelters (of which 14,852 were returned to the owner) and 20,017 cats.
The main goal of our project is to make it easier for animals all over Poland to find a home.

Main functionalities are:
- Adopting an animal in four steps (adoption process)
  1. First step is selecting an animal for adoption. On website there will be catalogue of available pets (divided into categories, breeds, cities etc.) and user chooses one of them. Information provided by the user upon registration (personal data, flat size, photos etc.) are transferred to the shelter for verification.
  2. After analyzing the data, the shelter may contact the applicant and decide whether or not to consent to the adoption application. If the shelter agrees, we go to step three, and if not, the process ends or the data is completed.
  3. The third step is to make an appointment with the selected animal and stay with it for some time. The user applying for adoption marks the possible date in the calendar on the website. Shelter must confirm the date.
  4. If all the previous steps have been followed, the fourth step is to adopt the pet.
- Making donations to the shelter
